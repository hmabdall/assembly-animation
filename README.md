Particle Animation in Assembly
==================

This is an animation I made with Cameron Beyer (http://www.cambeyer.com) in a computer science class while I was in high school. It's supposed to simulate portray a nucleus with some electrons orbiting it. It was done in assembly code written for the Motorola 68K processor. 

To view and edit the source code, you must use Easy68K, which is the only editor available for working in 68K assembly code.

Easy68K is available for download here: http://www.easy68k.com/

To run it with music playing, you must place the quantum.wav video in the same directory as the source file when running it. The quantum.wav file is available here: http://mit.edu/hmabdall/Public/quantum.wav

If you only want to see it in action, here's a video capture by Cameron: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHBWG5XCNds
