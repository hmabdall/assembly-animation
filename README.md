Particle Animation in Assembly (with music by Symphony of Science)
==================

This is an animation I made with Cameron Beyer (cambeyer.com) in a computer science class while I was in high school. It was done in assembly code written for the Motorola 68K processor. To view and edit the source code, you must use Easy68K, which is the only editor available for working in 68K assembly code.

Easy68K is available for download here: http://www.easy68k.com/

If you only want to see it in action, here's a video capture by Cameron: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHBWG5XCNds
